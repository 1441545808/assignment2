# Assignment 2
Social Network Analysis

In Assignment 2 we will be looking at some disciplinary data from a middle school. The file "discipline-data.csv" shows which teacher sent which student to the principal during the semester.

We will be using the "igraph" package to visualize the disciplinary relationships between teachers and students as a network. You can read more about igraph here:

The instructions to Assignment 2 are in the Assignment 2.rmd file. Once you have finished, commit, push and pull your assignment back to the main branch.

Good luck!
